# Settlers of Catan
## Overview
A text based implementation of the popular turn based game.

The primary scope of my contribution was development and implementation of the game state and interface.

Created with team members Beau Mahadev and Al Sandoval for CS 3110: Functional Programming in OCaml at Cornell University.

## Playing the Game
1. Run `make play` to build and start a one player game

2. `help` may be inputted to list all ingame commands

3. `quit` may be inputted to kill main.ml, or `cmd+c` at any time
