# Settlers of Catan
## Overview
A text based implementation of the popular turn based game. Its commandline based gameplay is slightly unintuitive, but it is entirely 
functional and has a charm. 

The primary scope of my contribution was development and implementation of the game state and interface. 
Created with team members Beau Mahadev and Al Sandoval for CS 3110: Functional Programming in OCaml at Cornell University.

## Playing the Game
1. Start a one player game with the terminal command \<make play\> in the repo directory
2. \<help\> may be inputted to list all ingame commands
3. \<quit\> may be inputted to kill main.ml (can only be done after setup phase)
